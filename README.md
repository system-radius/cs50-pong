# cs50-pong
A remake of the original Pong game. Made with instructions from Harvard's CS50.

As a requirement for CS50 GD, this has an update for the Pong game to include AI functionality.

The AI themselves can only move the board as a normal player moves it. This means that the AI cannot accurately position the paddle relative to the ball, allowing for some miss alignments.

Made with Love2D (v0.10.2)
